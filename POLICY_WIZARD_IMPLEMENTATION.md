# Policy Wizard Implementation

This document outlines the features, architecture, and implementation plan for the Policy Wizard system that will enable credential access control through defined policies.

## Overview

The Policy Wizard allows administrators to create and manage policies that control how credentials can be accessed. It provides both a user-friendly interface for non-technical users and advanced options for developers.

## Core Requirements

- Support multiple policy types (Allow Lists, Deny Lists, Time-Based, Count-Based, Manual Approval)
- Provide both simple and advanced creation modes
- Enable policy testing and simulation before saving
- Integrate with credential system
- Support policy versioning and history
- Provide visual policy builder for complex rules

## Implementation Progress Summary

### Backend Preparation
- [x] Enhanced the `CredentialPlugin` interface to include policy blueprint capabilities
- [x] Developed a comprehensive policy schema validation system using JSON schemas for different policy types
- [x] Implemented middleware for policy evaluation during credential operations
- [x] Added Prisma schema updates to support policy storage with versioning

### API Development
- [x] Created policy management endpoints (CRUD operations)
- [x] Implemented policy validation endpoints
- [x] Added policy simulation API for testing policies before saving
- [x] Established relationships between credentials and policies

### Frontend Implementation
- [x] Developed a multi-step Policy Wizard with intuitive navigation
- [x] Created three policy creation modes:
  - Template Mode: For non-technical users to select pre-built templates
  - Visual Builder: For creating policies through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface
  - Advanced JSON Mode: For direct JSON editing with schema validation
- [x] Implemented policy simulation functionality for testing policies
- [x] Developed policy management interface for viewing and editing policies

## Current Status

The Policy Wizard implementation is now complete. It provides a comprehensive policy management system that:

1. Allows users of all technical levels to create, edit, and manage credential access policies
2. Provides multiple modes of interaction (templates, visual builder, JSON editor) to cater to different user preferences
3. Ensures policy validity through schema validation and testing
4. Integrates seamlessly with the credential management system

## Next Steps

Future enhancements could include:

1. User experience refinements based on feedback
2. Advanced features like policy templates sharing
3. Integration with other security and compliance systems
4. [x] Analytics and reporting on policy effectiveness
