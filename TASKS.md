- [ ] Develop scaling strategy

## Development Workflow

To ensure we build the application methodically, we'll follow this workflow:

1. **Start with Core Infrastructure**
   - Complete Phase 1 first to establish the foundation
   - Ensure admin users can authenticate securely

2. **Build Credential and Application Management**
   - Develop Phases 2 and 3 in parallel
   - These are the core data entities we need to manage

3. **Implement Policy Engine**
   - With credentials and applications in place, develop the policy engine
   - Start with simple policies and add complexity

4. **Create Proxy Service**
   - Integrate all previous components into the proxy service
   - Test with simple request flows before adding complexity

5. **Add Audit and Monitoring**
   - Implement comprehensive logging and metrics
   - Create admin interfaces for monitoring

6. **Security Review and Testing**
   - Thoroughly test all components
   - Perform security reviews and fix issues

7. **Documentation and Deployment**
   - Document the system for developers and administrators
   - Finalize deployment procedures

## Progress Tracking

As we complete tasks, we'll mark them as done by changing `[ ]` to `[x]` in this document.
