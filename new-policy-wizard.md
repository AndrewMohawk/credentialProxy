# New Policy Wizard Implementation Plan

## Progress Update: June 5, 2023

We have completed the implementation of the plugin and credential verb discovery services, which are critical components for the natural language policy builder. These services enable dynamic discovery of available actions based on the specific plugins and credentials in the system. Key accomplishments include:

1. **Credential Verb Discovery Service**: Created a service that identifies and registers verbs specific to different credential types (AWS, databases, API keys, etc.).

2. **Plugin Verb Discovery Service**: Implemented a service that allows plugins to register their own verbs and provides methods for discovering verbs applicable to specific plugins.

3. **API Endpoints**: Added RESTful endpoints to expose credential and plugin-specific verbs to the frontend.

4. **Frontend Integration**: Updated the API client and hooks to fetch verbs for specific credentials and plugins.

5. **Server Initialization**: Added initialization code to ensure verb discovery services are properly started with the server.

These components provide the foundation for context-aware verb selection in the policy builder, enhancing the user experience by showing only relevant actions based on the selected credential or plugin.

## Progress Update: May 28, 2023

We have made significant progress on the natural language policy builder. The core components have been developed and integrated with the policies page. The following is a summary of our progress and next steps.

## Overview

We're redesigning the policy creation experience to use a natural language interface, making it more intuitive and accessible for users. The new approach will allow users to create policies using sentence-based patterns like:

> "If **[application]** wants to do **[action]** then **[allow/block]**"

This document outlines the implementation plan for this new wizard.

## Core Concepts

- **Natural Language Interface**: Policy creation using human-readable sentences
- **Dynamic Verbs**: Context-aware actions based on selected entity
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, allow complexity when needed
- **Multiple Creation Paths**: Simple builder, templates, and advanced JSON mode
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time visualization of policy behavior
